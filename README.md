# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on a large dataset of social media posts (e.g., tweets) to gauge public opinion about a specific topic/product/event. After preprocessing the data, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean the text, removing noise such as URLs, mentions, and stopwords. We then visualized the most common words using a word cloud, which highlighted key terms frequently discussed in the posts.
